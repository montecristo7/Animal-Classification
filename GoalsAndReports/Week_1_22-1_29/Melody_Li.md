- [ ]  GOAL 1: explore the format of a sample of finished video annotations and write a program to extract frames from the video together with the bounding box to be used as correctly formatted training image for the image classification and object detection models

Finishing this goal will move my team toward training image models with new data. 

- [ ]  GOAL 2: start working on the final white paper our team submitted last semester, going over the comments and making some adjustments

Finishing this goal will land my team in a good position when we start to revise and add new content to our white paper later on. 

[Expected Working Timeline](https://www.notion.so/e35f48e328a74eeab11f0c3c8e12e643)

I will work independently on both of the goals. 

The week is ambitious and I expect it to take around 8 - 10 hours.
